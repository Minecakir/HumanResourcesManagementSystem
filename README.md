### Create Java Spring Boot Project
Go To [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)
  
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67970973/182492368-52f8fce9-ad60-46e2-9794-7e978be2cd58.png" width="600" />
 
## Entities Package
Our system has three basic types of users. System Staff, Candidates and Employers.
Based on these requirements, I created my [User](https://github.com/Minecakir/HumanResourcesManagementSystem/blob/master/src/main/java/com/example/hrms/entities/concretes/User.java), 
[Employer](https://github.com/Minecakir/HumanResourcesManagementSystem/blob/master/src/main/java/com/example/hrms/entities/concretes/Employer.java) and 
[Candidate](https://github.com/Minecakir/HumanResourcesManagementSystem/blob/master/src/main/java/com/example/hrms/entities/concretes/Candidate.java) entities in my [Entity Package](https://github.com/Minecakir/HumanResourcesManagementSystem/tree/master/src/main/java/com/example/hrms/entities) for my project.
Then I continued to create my classes according to the necessary requirements.

## DataAccess Package
Let's talking about [Data Access](https://github.com/Minecakir/HumanResourcesManagementSystem/tree/master/src/main/java/com/example/hrms/dataAccess) Layer!
This layer is responsible for interacting with databases to save and restore application data.
Our basic  [Job](https://github.com/Minecakir/HumanResourcesManagementSystem/blob/master/src/main/java/com/example/hrms/entities/concretes/Job.java) entity class is simple and looks like below:
  
    public class Job {
    @Id
    @Column(name="id")
    private int id;
    
    @Column(name="title")
    private String jobTitle;
    
    @OneToMany(mappedBy="jobPos")
    private List<JobAdvertisement> jobAdvertisements;
    }
It's a simple JPA entity with id field as identifier. Now comes the best part, we ofcourse need some code to store and retrieve products from database. Good news is Spring has got us covered. 
All you need to do is define a repository as below
  
    public interface JobDao extends JpaRepository<Job,Integer> {
    }
 
What Spring data jpa provides is

- **No-code repository:** It is the most popular persistence-related pattern. It enables us to implement our business code on a higher abstraction level.
- **Reduced boilerplate code:** It provides the default implementation for each method by its repository interfaces. It means that there is no longer need to implement read and write operations.
- **Generated Queries:** Another feature of Spring Data JPA is the generation of database queries based on the method name. If the query is not too complex, we need to define a method on our repository interface with the name that starts with findBy.
  
 ## Business Package
 The business layer handles all the business logic. It consists of **service classes** and uses services provided by data access layers. It also performs authorization and validation.
Example create a service class that name [JobManager](https://github.com/Minecakir/HumanResourcesManagementSystem/blob/master/src/main/java/com/example/hrms/business/concretes/JobManager.java) with the following content into it: 
  
    @Service
    public class JobManager implements JobService {
    
    private JobDao jobDao;
    
    @Autowired
    public JobManager(JobDao jobDao){
    super();
    this.jobDao = jobDao;
    }
    
    @Override
    public DataResult<List<Job>> getAll() {
    return new SuccessDataResult<List<Job>>(this.jobDao.findAll(),"Jobs are listed.")
    }
    
    @Override
    public Result add(Job job) {
    this.jobDao.save(job);
    return new SuccessResult("Job position is added.");
    }
   }
  
## Controllers Package
After this, let's build the Spring REST Controller class to display the service to the client or end-user and evaluate input validation for the application:
The resource has representations like XML, HTML, and JSON. The current state capture by representational resource. When we request a resource, we provide the representation of the resource. The important methods of HTTP are:

- **GET:** It reads a resource.
- **PUT:** It updates an existing resource.
- **POST:** It creates a new resource.
- **DELETE:** It deletes the resource.

HTTP also defines the following standard status code:
- **404:** RESOURCE NOT FOUND
- **200:** SUCCESS
- **201:** CREATED
- **401:** UNAUTHORIZED
- **500:** SERVER ERROR

#### Implementing the POST Method to create Job Resource
  
In the previous few steps, we have created simple RESTful services. In this section, we will use the POST method to post the user resource for the specific URI "/api/jobs."
Here we are using two annotations, **@RequestBody** and **@PostMapping**.

<details>
<summary>@RequestBody</summary>
<br>
The @RequestBody annotation maps body of the web request to the method parameter. The body of the request is passed through an HttpMessageConverter.
Optionally, automatic validation can be applied by annotating the argument with @Valid.
</details>
  
        @RestController
        @RequestMapping("/api/jobs")
        public class JobsController {
        
        private JobService jobService;
        
        @Autowired
        public JobsController(JobService jobService){this.jobService = jobService;}
        
        @GetMapping("/getAll")
        public DataResult<List<Job>> getAll(){return this.jobService.getAll();}
        
        @PostMapping("/addJob")
        public Result add(@RequestBody Job job) {
        return this.jobService.add(job);
        }   
       }
